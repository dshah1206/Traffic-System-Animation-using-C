# Traffic-System-Animation-using-C
The following is a simple computer graphics mini project, which was created by me in 2017.

It uses the Graphics.h library in C (#include<graphics.h>).

It has animations that show vehicles following the traffic signal. 

It uses the coordinate (pixel) system and the boundary fill algorithm presented in the basics of computer graphics.

## Requirements:

1) Turbo C DOSBOX
2) BGI Library.

## Steps to follow:

1) Clone the repository
2) Download the code into the BGI folder (C:\\TC\\BGI).
3) Startup the Turbo C DOSBOX and mount the BGI folder through DOS shell box
4) Compile the code (Alt+F9)
5) Run the code (Ctrl+F9)

## Check the Traffic Animation PDF for the screenshot of the Output:
